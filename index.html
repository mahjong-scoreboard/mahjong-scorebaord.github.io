    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p><strong>The short version: We don't want your data, and we don't have it.</strong></p>
    
    <p>This application is designed to be <strong>completely offline</strong>. Your data never leaves your device unless you manually choose to share it with someone standing right next to you.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Cloud Collection:</strong> We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or usage stats to any servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All app data is stored locally on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>Score Sharing & Local Connectivity</h3>
        <p>The score sharing feature uses <strong>Local WiFi Direct</strong>. This allows you to share your achievements with nearby friends without an internet connection.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer Only:</strong> Data is sent directly from one device to another; it never passes through the internet or our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Initiated:</strong> Sharing only happens when you explicitly trigger it. The app will never share your score automatically.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Your privacy is protected by design. If you delete the app, all associated data is removed from your device.</p>
